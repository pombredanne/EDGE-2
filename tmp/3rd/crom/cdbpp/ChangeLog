	* CDB++ 1.1:
	- Fixed a compile issue (a patch submitted by Takashi Imamichi).
	- Replaced SuperFastHash with MurmurHash 2.0 (a patch submitted
	  by Takashi Imamichi).
	- Classes cdbpp::builder_base and cdbpp::cdbpp_base taking a
	  template argument to configure a hash function. Classes
	  cdbpp::builder and cdbpp::cdbpp are now the synonyms of
	  cdbpp::builder_base<cdbpp::murmurhash2> and
	  cdbpp::cdbpp_base<cdbpp::murmurhash2>, respectively.
	- Split the sample code into build and read functions.
