======================================================================
1. Introduction
======================================================================
Constant Database PlusPlus (CDB++) is a C++ implementation of hash
database specialized for serialization and retrieval of static
associations between keys and their values. This library implements
the data structure of the Constant Database proposed by Daniel J.
Bernstein. CDB++ also incorporates the fast and collision-resistant
hash function for strings (MurmurHash 2.0) implemented by Austin
Appleby. Since CDB++ is implemented in a single header file (cdbpp.h),
one can use the CDB++ API only by including cdbpp.h in a source code.

Refer to the CDB++ web site for more information.
