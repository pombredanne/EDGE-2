Grog is a lightweight dialogue, inventory and quest system written in C++11. Your favourite beverage as well.

### basics

- An inventory is a tree of items.
- Items can be game loots (ie: sword, potion, gems...).
- Items can be game attributes (ie: health, stamina, speed...).
- Items can be game dialogues and facts.
- Items can be game quests.
- Players, monsters, loots and NPCs are just inventories, with pretty sprites, animations, particles and optional scripts or behaviours.
